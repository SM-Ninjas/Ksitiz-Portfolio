                We can't expect a push from every one for the initiation. But some pauses are the best things that can happen to adapt the change or boost your ego".

                This was a statement by a senior regarding my decision to start a podcast. Insight A Podcast is a COVID-born idea that couldn't see the light of the day for a year and more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea to host a podcast by a person who has kept his face private from every social media was a hard thing. But even if every other person was doing it, I was not scared even if I failed because no one besides few hundreds would even know that I tried it. Trust me when I say few hundreds because while I have 500+ friends and relatives, I've got only 235 subscriptions in my channel.

                Today, I thank every pause that I have had in my life. If you are personally interested in marketing domain, its knowledge and profession then do view the videos and subscribe only if it fits your interest.

                Placement year is not about job and a marketing strategy by Sunway. It is a right approach to bridge the gap in between industry and academia through the education and awareness to the students. 
                Sunway has been a start to many innovation, trend and marketing stunts. We, Sunway decided to start a new culture of job placement in Nepal at least. The placement module at Sunway is from 3 months to 9 months for any module. This is a new and very risky step to be honest but that is what is required for the youth to understand about work culture, their passion and career. 
                The present challenges such as lack of skilled human capital, brain drain and ____ are a major issue faced by the industry in Nepal. The problem cannot only be solved by any specific individual stakeholder and being a linking stakeholder Sunway has decided to do what we can with what we have. 
                The upskilling program of Sunway along the industry’s involvement shall address the challenges. The placement is Sunway is accessible to the companies who are willing to comply with the 2 major parts :- 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Paid placements to the students
                </li>
                <li>
                    Compulsory college visit of supervisor and higher-level officials at Sunway for minimum 8 hours monthly
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Point 1 caters to celebrate the efforts and skillset of students and is a major motivation for students to continue the work as per the survey with the young minds. 
                The second steps allows industry to directly access the students through students incubation center, guest lecture, bootcamps and seminars. The sight and effort of Nepalese industry to the students surly has a greter touch than a single or multi placement days.  (re-write this)
                And, why would industry want to invest their time you ask. I would recommend you to visit the course module and see how our students are industry ready in the 2nd year itself.
